# Enter Data

<h2>We can key value directly into a table, like we would on a spreadsheet, and load it into our data model</h2>

<h3>
<i>Example</i>
</h3>

> Clicking on Enter Data on the Home TAB and copy pasting a table for EXCEL
> Since both the excel table and our native Table has catogory collumn, it was linked automaticly 
>
> We cannot name a collumn Measures as its a reserved keyword, but its usefull to create a table by entering data just to put our measures in it 


<h2>We can also Add A new Query in Power Query by right clicking a collumn</h2>

<br>

> What happens is that PWQ takes that 1 collumn and creates a new query using just that data
> 
> In case of duplicates in our new query we can just click remove duplicates from our home tab
> 
> We can convert the new created query into a table if we want, we can also use a delimiter to have more than 1 collumn
